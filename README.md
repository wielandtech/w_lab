My Kubernetes homelab: more expensive and less reliable than the cloud, but way more fun!

#### Motivation
The goal of this project is to give all of my networking toys a home that fits in the attic crawl-space or on a self in the basement.

Eventually, this project will culminate with my own private cloud and self-hosted kubernetes cluster, so I would like to keep performance and upgradability in mind. Going to start with k3s with the eventual goal of Talos.
